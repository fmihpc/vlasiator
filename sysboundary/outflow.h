   /*!\brief Outflow is a class applying copy/outflow boundary conditions.
    * 
    * Outflow is a class handling cells tagged as sysboundarytype::OUTFLOW by this system boundary condition. It applies copy/outflow boundary conditions.
    * 
    * These consist in:
    * - Copy the distribution and moments from the nearest NOT_SYSBOUNDARY cell;
    * - Copy the perturbed B components from the nearest NOT_SYSBOUNDARY cell. EXCEPTION: the face components adjacent to the simulation domain at the +x/+y/+z faces are propagated still.
