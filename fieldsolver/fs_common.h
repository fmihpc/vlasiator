/*!< Boundary status flags for all cells on this process. Here "boundary cell" 
 * means that the cell is at the physical boundary of the simulation volume, 
 * in some cases this condition means that this cell is a "ghost cell". However, 
 * this is algorithm-dependent, so one must be careful with ghost cell definition.
 * 
 * Consider a cell and its immediate neighbours (26 in total), i.e. a 3x3 cube 
 * of cells at base grid level. Considered cell is at the center of the cube. 
 * Number the cells with the usual C array numbering, k*9+j*3+i, where i,j,k 
 * are the cell indices in x,y,z directions. Each existing cell within the 
 * 3x3 cube has its bit (calculated with C array indexing) flipped to value 1.
 * The bit 13 is always set to unit value (considered cell always exists).
 * 
 * These boundary flags can be used to determine whether a numerical algorithm 
 * should be applied to a cell, for example, to calculate an edge electric field.
 * The boundary status can be checked with a single bitwise operation instead of 
 * N if-statements.
 * 
 * Note that this definition works with mesh refinement. The boundary flag 
 * should only change for a cell if some of its neighbours are deleted or 
 * created during the simulation.

/*! \brief Calculate the neighbour number.
 * 
 * Calculate the neighbour number. For the inspected cell the (i,j,k) are (1,1,1). Add or 
 * reduce one from an index to get the "neighbour number" for the neighbour in that direction. 
 * For example, neighbour number for i-1,j-1,k neighbour is calculated with calcNbrNumber(1-1,1-1,1+0).
 * Thus, the cell in question has a "neighbour number" 13.
 * The purpose of this function (and neighbour numbers) is to indicate whether a cell has 
 * existing neighbours on a given direction. The neighbour existence status can be stored in 
 * a single 32bit word and tested with bitwise operations.
