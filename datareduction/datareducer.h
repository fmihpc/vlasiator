/** The purpose of DataReducer is to contain DRO::DataReductionOperators, and apply 
 * them to simulation data when writing output files. Files containing full 
 * distribution functions of every spatial cell require so much disk space 
 * that they cannot be written out so often as user would want. Thus, derived 
 * quantities need to be calculated for every spatial cell, which are then 
 * written to data files. This process is here called data reduction.
