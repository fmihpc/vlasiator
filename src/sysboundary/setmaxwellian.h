    * 
    * Maxwellian is a class handling cells tagged as sysboundarytype::MAXWELLIAN by this
    * system boundary condition.
    * 
    * It applies fixed Maxwellian settings to the system boundary cells, the parameters of
    * which are being read from an input file.
    * 
    * The class inherits most of its machinery from
    * SysBoundaryCondition::SetByUser. The parameters are more general than for Maxwellian
    * and could be put in SysBoundaryCondition::SetByUser but this way they can have a
    * specific prefix which is needed if several inheriting classes are needed.
